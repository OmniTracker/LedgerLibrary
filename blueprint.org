   - Lorelai does not counter: Alice receives her deposit
   - Lorelai does counter:     If Third party confirms Lorelai sent, she receives the deposit
                               Otherwise Lorelai is lying and Alice receives her deposit
   - Alice has no incentive to lie as she can only lose her security deposit
   - Lorelai has no incentive to lie as she can only receive the security deposit if she can prove
     she actually sent the book

 - Alice -> Lorelai. Lorelai reject
   - Alice does not counter: Lorelai receives the deposit
