** Questions

 - difference between _books.exist and exists(bookID)

** Steps for loaning / trading

*** loan

 - make newBook

 - returnBook
 - archiveBook

*** trade

 - make newBook
 - requestBook
 - commitBook
 - commitEscrow
 - sendBook
 - acceptBook ( + trade token)
** reject book

 - Lorelai -> Alice. Alice reject
   - Lorelai does not counter: Alice receives her deposit
   - Lorelai does counter:     If Third party confirms Lorelai sent, she receives the deposit
                               Otherwise Lorelai is lying and Alice receives her deposit
   - Alice has no incentive to lie as she can only lose her security deposit
   - Lorelai has no incentive to lie as she can only receive the security deposit if she can prove
     she actually sent the book

 - Alice -> Lorelai. Lorelai reject
   - Alice does not counter: Lorelai receives the deposit
   - Alice does counter:     If Third party confirms Alice sent, she receives the deposit
                             Otherwise Alice is lying and Lorelai receives the deposit
